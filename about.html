                        Hey there.
                        Thanks for checking out my 'About Me' page.
                        My name is Chanice Ward.
                        My first name is pronounced 'Shah-nees.'
                        It means the Lord is gracious. 
                        It is also a combination of two of my grandmothers' names: Charlene and Janice.
                        <br>
                        I come from a family of hard-workers, business owners, musicians, and creatives.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was born in Augusta, Georgia and consider both Georgia and New York home.
                        Home for me is also Glory City Aiken,
                        which has a special place in my heart.
                        It's also where I'm a part of a worship team
                        and help run sound as an audio engineer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Growing up,
                        I wanted to be a pediatrician and travel around the world and help set up medical clinics.
                        By the time I was 15, I wanted to be a screenwriter.
                        I ended up studying film and video in college;
                        and later fell in love with songwriting.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Being creative -- it's in my DNA.
                        From writing poetry,
                        to publishing books,
                        to creating journals,
                        to capturing photographs while sightseeing
                        --
                        they all make my heart smile.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Aside from being creative,
                        I heart connecting with people.
                        To be able to connect with others is a gift.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Whether it's working as part of a team,
                        going on adventures,
                        learning something new,
                        brainstorming ideas,
                        finding solutions,
                        or finding ways to make things and processes more efficient for others,
                        <br>
                        these are all things I believe I was created to do. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was born to create and to be a blessing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And to be able to use technology to help improve other peoples' lives
                        (and to see their dreams come to fruition) is another blessing.
