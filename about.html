                I’m Shah-nees. A visual artist. An audio engineer. A poet. A sightseeing photographer. 
                And now a web developer — in training. 
                Ha. I come from a family of hard workers and undercover creatives. 
                Feel free to ask me about that later. 
                Creativity and seeing beauty — they’re in my DNA. 
                Aside from being creative, I enjoy connecting with others. 
                Connection and collaboration are golden. 
                Empathy and friendship are my chosen specialties (a.k.a my superpowers). 
                From brainstorming ideas, to working as part of a team, 
                to finding solutions and ways to make processes more efficient and user-friendly for others — 
                these are all things I believe I was born to do, to learn more about, and to excel at. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I’ve been told by loved ones that I can do anything I put my mind to. 
                Even when something appears or seems difficult. Persevere. 
                And if it seems too hard — REST. Regroup. And then try again. 
                Because sometimes, it’s about conquering the little steps. 
                While also knowing you don’t have to do it all by yourself. 
                That’s what community is for. 
                Back to perseverance — it’s a beautiful thing. 
                Or should I say ‘it’s like 2 sides of a rare coin?’ 
                Because yes, it can be hard to persevere in the moment. 
                But it’s usually always worth it. 
                So dream wild. Dream great.
                You were born to love and create. 
                You. are. capable. 
                And with vision, persistence, rest, wonder, 
                and confidence in who God is and who He created you to be, 
                the dreams in your heart are possible. 
                Like that quote: ‘Nothing is impossible, even the word itself says “I’m possible!”’
